## Applied Data Science Course ##

This course covers everything from the basics of data cleaning and visualisation to more advanced topics such as machine learning and deep learning. This course focuses on practical application. We work with real datasets, apply techniques to real problems, and learn how to make sense of complex data. 

Python is the core language for all assignments. We are using a multitude of libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. We also use GitHub for version control, which helps in tracking progress and collaborating.

The course is split into 6 modules. In the Final Project we will be able to apply everything we learnt throughout these modules to the dataset and subject of our choice.
