## Applied Data Science Course ##

This course covers everything from the basics of data cleaning and visualization to more advanced topics like machine learning. The best part? It’s all about practical application. We work with real datasets, apply techniques to real problems, and learn how to make sense of complex data.

We learn Python : The core language for all assignments and labs.
Jupyter Notebooks: These were super helpful for writing code and explanations in one place.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. We also use GitHub for version control, which helps in tracking progress and collaborating.

The course is split into weekly lectures and lab sessions:

Assignments: Each assignment is a practical task, like cleaning data or building a basic model, which really helps in reinforcing what we learned in lectures.
Final Project: We will apply everything we learn to a dataset of our choice, going through the entire data science workflow from start to finish.

It’s challenging but in a way that really builds your confidence. I am building confidence, ready to tackle data-driven problems and continue learning on my own.
