## Final Project ## 
This report analyzes doping patterns in professional sport using World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) data from 2014 to 2022. It combines exploratory analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction to identify substance use trends, high-risk sports, and evolving doping behaviors. The study highlights consistent use of anabolic agents in strength-based disciplines and identifies Cannabinoids, Stimulants, and Beta-2 Agonists as key substances shaping sport-specific doping profiles. Findings reveal structural and temporal patterns that can support more targeted, risk-based anti-doping strategies for policymakers and sporting bodies.
